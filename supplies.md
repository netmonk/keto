List of supplies you might want to keep on hand.

    - [NU3 Organic almond flour](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-bio-farine-amande-500-g.html)
      - Lower fat content (~15%, 50% protein)
      - Finely ground, closer to wheat flour than typical "ground almonds"
      - **Warning** : when measuring by volume (cups, tablespoons...), dial down to 80%
  - Coconut flour
    - [NU3 Organic coconut flour](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-bio-farine-de-coco-800-g.html)
      - Standard stuff
    - Higher carb count than almond, but usually smaller amounts needed
  - Psyllium husk powder
    - [NU3 Psyllium Husk Powder](https://www.nu3.fr/enveloppes-de-psyllium-biologique-nu3-250-g.html)
    - 85% fiber
    - Natural thickening/binding agent, turns water into jelly!
    - Used when baking w/ coconut or almond flour (which lack gluten)
    - Typically for "moist" recipes (bread, cakes ...)
  - Xanthan gum
    - Binding/thickening agent
    - Typically for "dry" recipes (cookies ...)

## Sweeteners

  - Xylitol
    - [NU3 Xylitol](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-xylitol-poudre-1000-g.html)
    - [Xucker] (untested, cheaper)](https://www.nu3.fr/xucker-premium-xylitol-de-finlande-2-x-1000-g.html)
    - Sweetness very close to actual sugar (1:1)
    - GI: ~7-10
    - Limited aftertaste
    - **Toxic to dogs (and maybe cats)** : store accordingly
  - Erythritol
    - [NU3 Erythritol](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-erythritol-poudre-1000-g.html)
    - Lower sweetness (~80%)
    - GI: 0
    - Cool after-taste
    - Safe for pets
  - Liquid stevia
    - [Stevia Sweet liquid stevia](https://www.nu3.fr/steviasweet-liquid-gouttes-50-ml.html)
    - Only use a few drops
    - Can be used to sweeten stuff that doesnt require bulk but can be bitter when on its own
    - Can be used to "boost" sweetness when baking

You may want to blend Xylitol and Erythritol (50-50) to tone down the aftertaste from erythritol while averaging down the overall GI.

Stevia works great to tweak the sweetness level but may not be very useful on its own. YMMV.

## Pasta substitute

  - Shirataki / Konjac noodles
    - Extruded as
      - [spaghetti](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-low-carb-spaghetti-2-x-200-g.html)
      - [fettucini](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-smart-low-carb-fettuccine-2-x-200-g.html]
      - tagliatelle
      - [rice](https://www.nu3.fr/nu3-riz-low-carb-2-x-200-g.html)
    - Can be used as noodle substitute:
      - in soup
      - in stir-frys
      - with homemade bolognese or other kind of sauce
    - Essentially useless from the nutrition angle: water + some fiber
    - Tasteless: eat them with generous amount of sauce, or in stir-frys.
    - Texture slightly different from regular pasta
    - Buy a pack or two to test before buying bulk: some people just don't like the lack of taste and/or texture
    - How to prepare them:
      1. Remove them from package and drain the water
      2. Thoroughly rince them w/cold water to remove any taste from the storage water
      3. Drain in a pasta strainer
      4. In a non-stick pan, heat the noodles (no fat !) to dry them out. Approx 5-8min. This helps with the texture.
      5. Add sauce or toss in your stir-fry

Before going LCHF, I would have a 2:1 pasta-to-sauce/meat ratio. These days it's the other way around: 1 part noodle substitute to 2 or 3 parts bolognese sauce. I'm *this close* to eating bolognese sauce without konjac noodles anyway. :)

## Bread

If you don't feel like baking your own low carb bread:

  - Ready-to-mix low-carb bread
    - [Konzelmann's L-Carnitine mix](https://www.nu3.fr/konzelmanns-preparation-pain-vitalbrot-low-carb-a-la-l-carnitine-pack-de-deux-2-x-370-g.html)
      - Easy to bake, just add water, let it rise, put it in a baking form and bake
      - On the heavy/dense side
      - Can be toasted
      - Can be stored a few days in the fridge without drying out

## Pizza dough

If you don't feel like making your own _fat head_ pizza:

  - Ready-to-mix low carb pizza
    - [Konzelmann' pizza mix](https://www.nu3.fr/konzelmanns-preparation-pizza-low-carb-pack-de-deux-2-x-170-g.html)
      - Add water, mix, let it rise, spread on baking sheet.
      - You may want to bake the dough a few minutes on its own before adding the tomato sauce/toppings
      - Overall a decent susbtitute (a little high in carbs though, I would consider it only in maintenance)
