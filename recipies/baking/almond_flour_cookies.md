## Ingredients

  - 60g of butter
  - 3/4 cup of NU3 Almond flour
    - If using standard ground almonds (coarser), use 1 cup as in original recipe from KC
  - 1/4 cup xylitol
  - 1/4 cup erithritol
  - 5-10 drops of Stevia
    - May not be needed if using higher carb (= sweeter) chocolate chips
    - May not be needed depending on the sweetness level you're comfortable with
  - 1 egg
  - 1/2 Teaspoon baking powder
  - 1/2 Teaspoon baking soda
  - 1 Teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1/4 Teaspoon salt (unless butter already has salt)
  - 1/4 Teaspoon xanthan gum
    - Optional, but helps
  - 30g crushed pecans
  - 40-50g chocolate chips
    - Use dark chocolate, 70% or higher
    - Use darker chocolate and add some stevia (see above) 
  - Extra: cinnamon (to taste)

## Kitchenware

  - Electric hand mixer or plain whisk (takes effort!)
  - One bowl to pre-mix dry ingredients
  - One bowl to mix the butter, sweeteners, egg
  - Baking sheet with parchment paper
  - Spatula
  - Measuring cups/teaspoons

## Recipe

  - Pre-heat the oven at 170C (convection)
  - Mix the almond flour, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, cinnamon, crushed pecans, chocolate chips in a bowl; set aside
    - Don't add the sweeteners!
    - Flour may stick to the chocolate chips, don't worry, the butter will pick it up when mixed!
  - Melt the butter (short burst in microwave, or very low heat in a non-stick saucepan)
  - In a bowl, mix the butter and xylitol/erithritol
    - Mix with a hand mixer in order to get a smooth/creamy mix
  - Add the vanilla extract and optional Stevia, keep mixing w/ hand mixer
  - Add the egg and keep mixing
  - Add the dry ingredients in the wet mix and mix with a spatula
    - Add a little at a time, in three or four passes
  - The dough will still be a little sticky
  - Two options
    - Cylinder / Knife
      - Roll the dough in a cylinder, approx 2"/5cm in diameter
      - Cut into 16 cookies and set on parchment paper, press them down to approx 5mm thickness
    - Spread / Cookie cutter
      - Spread the dough on parchment paper using a rolling pin to 5mm thickness
      - Use a cookie cutter to cut consistent cookies
   - Put in the oven approximately 20 minutes in the oven, lower third
     - They'll still be pretty soft when coming out, this is normal
   - Take the cookies out and put them on a cooling rack and let them dry/harden (overnight !)
   - Next day, store them in sealed boxes
